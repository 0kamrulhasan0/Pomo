# Pomo (formerly Pomodore)
The vast majority of credit for this addon goes to https://github.com/Aliuakbar.

This version just allows break time modification. The interface still looks a little buggy but I may fix it in the next few months.

## Introduction
This is an addon for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) which augments your
spaced repetition learning with the Pomodore technique. In brief: Work for 20
minutes and take a break of 5 minutes.
